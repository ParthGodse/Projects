## 1] Sentiment Analysis

To analyze the impact of twitter and news information on the Indian populace. We use covid-19 twitter public datasets and regular news scraping to implement this study work. In addition to training supervised learning models on approximately 45,000 tweets, we have implemented these models to ascertain the live public sentiment by collecting real time data from Twitter. We wish to show the simplicity of opinion mining and the large-scale impact of the Omicron pandemic in India. Corroborate opinion mined on Twitter to factual opinion obtained from Google news. Understanding supervised learning methods in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Comparing the results of XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier and TextBlob algorithms 

## 2] Data Mining Project (Data Driven insights from Airbnb & Price prediction)

Develop a predictive model for Airbnb price prediction, utilizing a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in New York containing 102,058 samples and 26 unique attributes. Our main goal is to offer a valuable tool for hosts and guests, enabling them to make informed choices when it comes to Airbnb property listings, while also allowing for more effective budget planning. Different methods ranging from Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost will be explored for the creation of the final prediction model.
