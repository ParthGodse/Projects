# Projects
## 1] Sentiment Analysis

To analyze the impact of twitter and news information on the Indian populace. We use covid-19 twitter public datasets and regular news scraping to implement this study work. In addition to training supervised learning models on approximately 45,000 tweets, we have implemented these models to ascertain the live public sentiment by collecting real time data from Twitter. We wish to show the simplicity of opinion mining and the large-scale impact of the Omicron pandemic in India. Corroborate opinion mined on Twitter to factual opinion obtained from Google news. Understanding supervised learning methods in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Comparing the results of XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier and TextBlob algorithms 

## 2] Data Mining Project (Data Driven insights from Airbnb & Price prediction)

Develop a predictive model for Airbnb price prediction, utilizing a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in New York containing 102,058 samples and 26 unique attributes. Our main goal is to offer a valuable tool for hosts and guests, enabling them to make informed choices when it comes to Airbnb property listings, while also allowing for more effective budget planning. Different methods ranging from Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost will be explored for the creation of the final prediction model.

## 3] Employee Attrition

Forecasted employee attrition using MongoDB, SQL, and Apache Spark on a dataset comprising 34 features and 1500 real examples. Trained and evaluated six models, with GBTClassifier achieving the highest accuracy of 89%. The predictive model identified key factors contributing to attrition, allowing the organization to take measures in retaining valuable talent and
reducing turnover by 11%. Implemented real-time data updates through MongoDB Atlas and used Power BI for analysis of visualizations.

## 4] Topic Modelling

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. It includes classification hierarchy, Topic modelling methods, different evolution models of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Latent semantic analysis (LSA). Data preprocessing ws done using NLP techniques while incorporating pyLDAvis and gensim for visualization as well and above models for comparative study.

## 4] XAI-GANs (Capstone Project)

Create our own deep faked audio using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) and objectively evaluate generator quality using Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) metric. We augment a pre-existing dataset of real audio samples with our fake generated samples and classify data as real or fake using MobileNet, Inception, VGG and custom CNN models. MobileNet is the best performing model with an accuracy of 91.5% and precision of 0.507. We further convert our black box deep learning models into white box models, by using explainable AI (XAI) models. We quantitatively evaluate the classification of a MEL Spectrogram through LIME, SHAP and GradCAM models. We compare the features of a spectrogram that an XAI model focuses on to provide a qualitative analysis of frequency distribution in spectrograms.

** Some of the above projects are done in a team and in collaboration with Atharva Gurav, Aditi Govindu and Aamir Hullur.
